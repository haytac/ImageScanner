## Features üöÄ

*   **Recursive Folder Scanning**: Scans specified folders for image files, with an option to include subdirectories.
*   **Configurable File Types**: Supports a configurable list of image extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`).
*   **File Size Filtering**: Allows specifying minimum and maximum file sizes to process.
*   **Advanced Metadata Extraction**: Extracts image dimensions (width, height) and detailed EXIF data (camera model, date taken, exposure, etc.) using the `MetadataExtractor` library.
*   **SQLite Database Storage**: Persists image information and metadata in a local SQLite database via Entity Framework Core.
*   **Asynchronous Operations**: All I/O-bound operations (file system access, database queries, metadata extraction) are fully asynchronous for improved performance and responsiveness.
*   **Cancellation Support**: Long-running operations like scanning can be gracefully cancelled using `Ctrl+C`.
*   **Batch Processing**: Images are processed and saved to the database in configurable batches for efficiency.
*   **Duplicate/Change Detection**:
    *   Avoids re-processing unchanged files based on path and file hash.
    *   Updates records if file content (hash) changes.
    *   Handles moved/renamed files by updating the path if the hash matches an existing record.
*   **Rich Console Output**: Utilizes `Spectre.Console` for user-friendly, colorful logging, progress bars, and summary tables.
*   **Interactive Mode**: Provides an interactive prompt for executing commands if no arguments are supplied at startup.
*   **Configuration via `appsettings.json`**: Key application settings are managed through a JSON configuration file.
*   **SOLID Principles & Modularity**: Designed with SOLID principles and a clear, modular project structure for maintainability and extensibility.

## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

*   [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) (or the latest .NET SDK version targeted by the project)

## Getting Started üèÅ

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url/ImageScanner.git
cd ImageScanner
```

### Restoring Dependencies

Restore the necessary NuGet packages for all projects in the solution:

```bash
dotnet restore ImageScanner.sln
```

The application is configured to automatically apply Entity Framework Core migrations on startup, so the database schema will be created or updated when you first run the application.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

Application behavior can be configured via the `appsettings.json` file located in the output directory of the `ImageScanner.Cli` project. If this file is not present, sensible defaults will be used.

Key configuration options under the `ImageScannerSettings` section:

*   `DefaultImageExtensions`: Array of image file extensions to scan (e.g., `[ ".png", ".jpg" ]`).
*   `DatabaseBatchSize`: Number of image records to process before committing to the database.
*   `DatabasePath`: Path to the SQLite database file. Can be absolute or relative to the execution directory.
*   `LogFilePath`: Path for a persistent log file (Note: current implementation focuses on console logging).
*   `MetadataFieldsToExtract`: Specific EXIF metadata fields to extract. Use `"*"` for all available fields recognized by `MetadataExtractor`.
*   `MinFileSize`: Minimum file size in bytes for an image to be processed (0 for no minimum).
*   `MaxFileSize`: Maximum file size in bytes (0 for no maximum).

Example `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "ImageScannerSettings": {
    "DefaultImageExtensions": [ ".png", ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".bmp", ".gif" ],
    "DatabaseBatchSize": 50,
    "DatabasePath": "Data/ImageScannerDB.sqlite",
    "LogFilePath": "Logs/ImageScannerApp.log",
    "MetadataFieldsToExtract": [
      "Make",
      "Model",
      "Date/Time Original",
      "Exposure Time",
      "F-Number"
    ],
    "MinFileSize": 1024, // 1KB
    "MaxFileSize": 0     // No limit
  }
}
```

## Usage üí°

### Running the Application

After building the project (see [Building the Project](#building-the-project)), you can run the CLI tool from the output directory (e.g., `ImageScanner.Cli/bin/Debug/net8.0/`).

```bash
# On Windows
ImageScanner.Cli.exe <command> [options]

# On Linux/macOS
./ImageScanner.Cli <command> [options]
```

### Interactive Mode

If you run the application without any arguments, it will start in interactive mode:

```bash
ImageScanner.Cli.exe
```

You'll be greeted with a welcome message and a prompt (`>`). Type commands directly into the prompt.

```
Welcome to ImageScanner!
Type 'help' for a list of commands or '<command> --help' for command-specific help.
Type 'exit' to close the application.
> scan --folder "C:\Users\YourUser\Pictures"
```

### Available Commands

#### `scan` Command

Scans a folder for images, extracts metadata, and stores it in the database.

**Syntax:**

```bash
scan -f|--folder <FOLDER_PATH> [options]
```

**Required Argument:**

*   `-f|--folder <FOLDER_PATH>`: The path to the folder to scan for images.

**Options:**

*   `-e|--extensions <EXTENSIONS>`: Comma-separated list of image extensions (e.g., `.png,.jpg`). Overrides defaults from `appsettings.json`.
*   `--min-size <MIN_SIZE_BYTES>`: Minimum file size in bytes.
*   `--max-size <MAX_SIZE_BYTES>`: Maximum file size in bytes.
*   `--no-subdirs`: Disable recursive scanning of subdirectories.
*   `--batch-size <BATCH_SIZE>`: Database commit batch size. Overrides `appsettings.json`.
*   `--summary`: Display a scan summary upon completion.

**Examples:**

1.  Scan a folder with default settings:
    ```bash
    scan --folder "D:\MyPhotos"
    ```
2.  Scan a folder for only JPG and PNG files, including subdirectories, and show a summary:
    ```bash
    scan --folder "/mnt/data/images" --extensions ".jpg,.png" --summary
    ```
3.  Scan a folder, excluding subdirectories, and set a minimum file size of 10KB:
    ```bash
    scan --folder "C:\Shared\Pics" --no-subdirs --min-size 10240
    ```

#### `exit` Command

Exits the application (primarily for interactive mode).

**Syntax:**

```bash
exit
```

#### `help` Command

Displays help information.

*   Show general help and list of commands:
    ```bash
    help
    ```
    (In interactive mode) or
    ```bash
    ImageScanner.Cli.exe --help
    ```
    (When run directly)

*   Show help for a specific command (e.g., `scan`):
    ```bash
    help scan
    ```
    (In interactive mode) or
    ```bash
    ImageScanner.Cli.exe scan --help
    ```
    (When run directly)

## Project Structure üìÇ

The solution is organized into four main projects:

*   **`ImageScanner.Cli`**: The main executable console application. Contains command definitions, `Program.cs` for setup, and handles user interaction.
*   **`ImageScanner.Core`**: Contains core abstractions (interfaces like `ILoggerService`, `IFileSystemService`, `IImageRepository`), domain models/DTOs (`ImageScannerSettings`), and constants. It has minimal dependencies.
*   **`ImageScanner.DataAccess`**: Manages all database interactions using Entity Framework Core. Contains the `DbContext`, entity classes (`ImageInfo`, `ProcessedFile`), and repository implementations.
*   **`ImageScanner.Infrastructure`**: Provides concrete implementations for interfaces defined in `ImageScanner.Core` (e.g., `SpectreConsoleLogger`, `FileSystemService`, `ImageMetadataService`).

This separation promotes loose coupling, testability, and maintainability.

## Database üíæ

### Schema

The application uses an SQLite database with two main tables:

1.  **`Images`**: Stores detailed information about each scanned image.
    *   `Id` (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
    *   `Name` (File name)
    *   `Path` (Full file path, unique index)
    *   `Size` (File size in bytes)
    *   `Width`, `Height` (Image dimensions)
    *   `FileHash` (SHA256 hash of file content, indexed)
    *   `FileCreatedAt`, `FileLastModifiedAt` (File system timestamps)
    *   `DateTaken` (From EXIF)
    *   `CameraModel` (From EXIF)
    *   `ExifDataJson` (Other extracted EXIF data as JSON)
    *   `ScannedAt` (Timestamp of when the record was last scanned/updated)
2.  **`ProcessedFiles`**: Tracks files that have been processed to optimize rescans.
    *   `Id` (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
    *   `Path` (Full file path, unique index)
    *   `FileHash` (SHA256 hash of file content)
    *   `LastProcessed` (Timestamp of last processing)

### Migrations

Entity Framework Core migrations are used to manage the database schema. The application is configured to automatically apply pending migrations on startup (`context.Database.MigrateAsync()` in `Program.cs`). This ensures the database schema is up-to-date when the application runs.

## Development üßë‚Äçüíª

### Building the Project

To build the solution:

```bash
dotnet build ImageScanner.sln --configuration Release
```

The executable will be in the respective `bin/Release/net8.0` folder of the `ImageScanner.Cli` project.

### Working with EF Core Migrations

If you make changes to the entity models in `ImageScanner.DataAccess.Entities` or `DbContext` configurations, you'll need to add a new migration and potentially update the database.

**Prerequisites for EF Core tools:**

Ensure you have the EF Core tools installed globally or locally. For global installation:
`dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`

**Adding a Migration:**

Navigate to the solution root or a project directory in your terminal.

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName> --project ImageScanner.DataAccess --startup-project ImageScanner.Cli
```

Replace `<MigrationName>` with a descriptive name for your migration (e.g., `AddImageDescriptionField`).

**Updating the Database (Applying Migrations Manually):**

While the app applies migrations automatically, you can also do it manually:

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project ImageScanner.DataAccess --startup-project ImageScanner.Cli
```

**Removing the Last Migration (if something went wrong):**

```bash
dotnet ef migrations remove --project ImageScanner.DataAccess --startup-project ImageScanner.Cli
```
